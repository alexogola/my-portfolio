# My Portfolio

A landing page for my programming portfolio.

## Project description

This project involves the development of a landing page to showcase my work as a web developer. I have embeded hyperlinked thumbnails on the landing page that lead to my projects on Github. The landing page also includes an "about me" section with information about myself as a developer, my hobbies and interests.

## Project setup instructions

Visit the link provided below which will lead you to my portfolio landing page.
The page has three main sections; "About me","My hobbies", "Portfolio".
The "Portfolio" section has hyperlinked thumbnails that will lead you to my projects on github.
